# Hotel Reservation Prediction System using KNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–based **Hotel Reservation Prediction System** that predicts whether a hotel booking will be **Confirmed** or **Canceled**. The system uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** to analyze historical booking data and identify patterns influencing reservation outcomes.

## Problem Addressed
Hotel cancellations lead to revenue loss and inefficient resource planning. This project helps hotels:
- Anticipate booking cancellations
- Improve room allocation and operational planning
- Support data-driven decision-making

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Dataset:** Hotel Reservation Dataset (CSV)

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- KNN-based classification model
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Insightful analysis of booking behavior

## Results
The KNN model achieved reliable accuracy in predicting reservation outcomes. Features such as **lead time** and **average room price** were found to significantly impact cancellations.

## Applications
- Hotel booking management systems
- Revenue and demand forecasting
- Hospitality analytics
